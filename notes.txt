    <h3>Firefox/Safari Positioning Issues</h3>
    <p>
        If you're using a browser like Firefox or Safari, for some reason they don't like anchoring absolute positioning divs to other components, so the dropdown menu for the 'about' section may look a bit wonk. I have no idea why this is happening but I guess it's just a thing.

        I've tested this website and on Chrome, Chromium, Opera, and Edge browsers it works fine. But on specifically Safari and Firefox it does not work.
