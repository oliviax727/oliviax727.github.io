    <h3>My personal life</h3>
    <p>
        The top 5 adjectives to describe me are: fast-thinking, logical, passionate, headstrong, and chill. I'm a very ambitious individual who still has a lot to work on and potential to utilise. Hence why I've got big plans. I'm also autistic and a bit of an introvert.
    </p><p>
        I come from a very international background. On my mothers' side, my grandmother is a German-Argentinian and my grandfather is Croatian. My dad's side is mostly Anglo-Australian. I also spent the most formative years of my childhood growing up in Hong Kong, going to a British international school, and having a Filipino babysitter. I also have an American twinge due to my babysitter. I've lived in Brisbane, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Sydney, Singapore, Canberra, and Perth and so I am quite proud of my international heritage.

        I have been learning Latin American Spanish since 2023, mainly so I can communicate with my relatives in Argentina, but also it's a really fun language to learn (and also quite romantic too). I was able to speak Mandarin Chinese until I began boarding school in Sydney. However in 2028 I plan on relearning the language. Mainly because I think it is a beautiful language and I can also talk to my mates.

        My main interests are in worldbuilding, video games, TTRPGs, and programming. And I spend most of my free time engaging in these pursuits.
    </p><p>
        While I don't play video games as often as most people of my generation, I have an affinity for very story-heavy games focused on worldbuilding. That or strategy and platformer games. I am a massive fan of Ace Attorney, Bloons, Fallout, Pokemon, Mario and have been slowly getting into card games as well.
    </p><p>
        I also very much enjoy sci-fi as a genre, it's my main sort-of thing actually. Star Wars, Star Trek, Futurama, Warhammer 40k, among all the others. Is it because it's related to my career as a scientist? Perhaps. But I also like any sort of creative fiction and worlds.
    </p><p>
        I also love to program. I do it casually and as a part of testing out interesting mathematical ideas I use. I also like tinkering with my Linux operating systems and playing around with the terminal application. I have plans to make my own text-based RPG, but I've never really gotten around to it.
    </p><p>
        In terms of other more minor interests, I often play around with constructing geometric shapes with a ruler and compass or with graphing applications. I also enjoy writing poetry and prose occasionally, mostly as a way to healthily engage with trauma.
    </p><p>
        My biggest interest is my worldbuilding. I do it to an obsessive degree. I plan on eventually typing up all this information onto a Tumblr blog, however for now I'm still in the process of compiling most of it. Over the course of my life, I've written many, many pages of lore about the 20 different universes I have - all of which are extremely in-depth. They range from sci-fi worlds to fantasy universes to fictional realities - and I take pride in how much effort I put into it. Even though I'm not really going to write a proper novel on any of it - these worlds are more for myself and also I prefer writing in a non-fiction short note format. These worlds influence all of my ideas about video games, poetry, roleplays, and RPGs. I also like creating my own OC's as well to fit in these worlds.

        I identify as a Bi-Gray-Ace Transgender Demigirl. What does that mean? Well I'm bisexual however I lean more on the asexual spectrum. I like all genders, with a specific lean towards women, but I don't experience a strong sexual attraction. Being a demigirl means that, while I still identify with the female label, there's a sense of a “neutrality” in how one feels about their gender. Of course being an AMAB makes me a transgender woman. This gender I feel is represented in my more butch presentation and assertiveness in all things. I've been on HRT since May 2022. I strongly prefer she/her but also like it/its and they/them - in that order.
    </p><p>
        I'm also a vegetarian. I've been so since November 2020 and I've never looked back. It's mostly about my ethical apprehension with eating meat, but I cannot deny that it has certainly helped me health-wise and it's not that I feel like I'm missing much by not eating meat. One interesting thing about being vegetarian is that fruits and vegetables taste significantly better. In an ironic twist I've found that I can enjoy all of my food now instead of just the meat.
    </p><p>
        I'm also spending 2025 trying to fix my health - mental, physical, and social. 2022-2024 was a rather rough time in my life and I want to get back on track. Because of this I've been getting much more physically active, mainly within the realm of walking - and eventually hiking and a martial art such as boxing. I started out November 2024 with a diet and so far have lost a fair amount of weight.
