    <h3>Programming Work</h3>
    <p>For most of my programming work, please see my GitHub profile:</p>
    <p><button onclick="location.href='https://github.com/Oliviax727';">Go to GitHub Profile</button></p>
    <p>You can also check out my work in other links (Repl, Tumblr):</p>

        If you're looking for which GitHub repos or other works to have a gander at, my Honours Research Code Base, my ASTR3005 Research Code Base and my Major Software Design and Development Code Base are all on GitHub. There are others you may take interest in like a tile-based RPG I wrote in Y11, a BlackJack applet, a videogame "Critical Statum: Contagion" that I have never gotten around to reprogramming since it's python creation in Y10, and also various assignments during my honours year.
