    <h3>About my political beleifs</h3>
    <p>
        I'm a rather politically engaged individual as well, sometimes out of necessity as being a transgender individual in the queer community, but also because I care about people and want to make the world a better place.
    </p><p>
        I am a very progressive individual, and hold it as a core value of mine. My main concern is on education, queer issues, women's rights, and environmentalism. I care a lot about how we teach and raise our children in ways that are not harmful or perpetuate cycles of abuse, and also because knowledge is power. I of course am incredibly concerned with my own safety and autonomy as a queer individual myself. It shouldn't be too difficult to follow as to why I label myself as an intersectional feminist and environmentalist.
    </p><p>
        I also think that education should be free and accessible to everyone. I think that higher education is something everyone should be able to do.
    </p><p>
        By principle I'm libertarian socialist. Of course progressive is quite clear as to what it is, however libertarian socialism? Doesn't that sound like an oxymoron? Fun fact, the original meaning of the word libertarian was exclusively a leftist term, and it was only until the 1950s when capitalists adopted the name that the clarifying suffix had to be added.
    </p><p>
        What a lot of people miss about socialism is that it's not meant to be authoritarian. And those who support the various 20th Century self-described “Communist” regimes don't really represent what socialism, nor communism, actually is about. It just so happens that authoritarians tend to adopt populist terms and descriptors in order to make them appear as if they care about the common people.
    </p><p>
        My grievances with authoritarianism aside. Libertarian socialism is simply a belief in building workplace democracy, and decommodification without relying heavily on the state to enact such change. My more specific belief, Anarcho-Communism, is a particular attempt to achieve a better world through building things from the ground-up. Prioritising community action, engagement, and equality, in opposition or without the violence of the state. One of the best books I'd recommend on anarchist philosophy is George Orwell's “Homage to Catalonia” - yes, that Orwell - he was actually a socialist!
    </p><p>
        In addition to this I am quite staunchly an agnostic-atheist and an anti-theist. I believe that we cannot prove that there is a higher power, and because of that we shouldn't bother with believing in something with no evidence. I'm also against the concept of religion as a whole. I think that people can fulfil their spiritual needs without needing to hold superstitious or incorrect beliefs, after all, I do enjoy engaging in certain heathen practices - although more for the aesthetic and as a means of roleplay - because I think it's no problem trying to play pretend and imagine things - my issue is when that stops becoming pretend and becomes a delusion.
    </p><p>
        There are a lot of reasons why I have formed my political beliefs in this manner. But I think what really helped is attending an all-boys, Christian, conservative, private high school. All of this made me question the authority of the people around me. It made me see the harm that toxic masculinity has done to people of all genders, and how pointless conservative beliefs can be.
    </p><p>
        In terms of action I was on a major hiatus in-terms of political activity in 2023/2024 due to depression, which was unfortunate as I missed out on having my voice heard by contributing to ANU's Palestinian encampment.
    </p><p>
        Currently I am a committed member of the Australian Greens, and help volunteer for their cause. I've even considered running for office to normalise trans people like me or learning law to aid public defenders/state barristers in their quest for justice for the common person.
    </p><p>
        While I am not a member of the NTEU, due to not having a tutoring job at the moment, I do contribute to them by supporting their strikes. And I intend on helping them out by becoming a member.
