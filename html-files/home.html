    <h3>Welcome</h3>
    <p>
        Hi! I'm Olivia (she/they/it), I'm a <span class="age" date="2003-04-16"></span> year old PhD student currently studying at the Curtin Institute for Radio Astronomy in Perth. I'm also a big fan of computer science and physics more broadly, and you may see me doing tutoring for these subjects. I'm a proud bisexual trans woman who loves to create and divulge in my own creative worlds, play around with computer software, and play video games/TTRPGs. I also love to sleep and hike.

    <h3>About this webpage</h3>
    <p>
        This webpage is a bit of a bodge-job, as most websites are. It's a bit on the basic end but simplicity is always better!
    </p><p>
        This website works on mobile as well! I tried to make the website work for most browsers, including on phone.
    </p><p>
        Also note that I routinely will orphan this repository for security reasons.
