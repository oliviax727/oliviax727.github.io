    <h3>Welcome</h3>
    <p>
        Hi! I'm Olivia (she/they/it), I'm a <span class="age" date="2003-04-16"></span> year old PhD student currently studying at the Curtin Institute for Radio Astronomy in Perth. I'm also a big fan of computer science and physics more broadly, and you may see me doing tutoring for these subjects. I'm a proud bisexual trans woman who loves to create and divulge in my own creative worlds, play around with computer software, and play video games/TTRPGs. I also love to sleep and hike.

        This website's purpose is primarily for both personal and professional use. To store my important academic works and history, but also to show the world who I am. Feel free to browse around!

    <h3>About this webpage</h3>
    <p>
        This webpage is a bit of a bodge-job, as most websites are. It's a bit on the basic end but simplicity is always better!
    </p><p>
        NB: The website doesn't really work on mobile. I'm probably not going to be bothered making it work for mobile either. Maybe later! Regardless, computers are always going to give you a better experience.

        Also note that I routinely will orphan this repository for security reasons.
