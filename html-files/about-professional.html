    <h3>About my professional career and history</h3>
    <p>
        My focus is within the realm of Computational Astrophysics. With my PhD thesis specifically focusing on the intersection between Radio Astronomy, Radio Instrumentation, Cosmology, Instrumentation Simulations, and Astrophysical Simulations. I'm working with <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6324-1766">Prof. Cathryn Trott</a> at Curtin University on projects ranging from <a href="https://github.com/OxfordSKA/OSKAR">OSKAR</a>, the <a href="https://www.mwatelescope.org">Murchison Widefield Array</a> (MWA), and <a href="https://www.skao.int/en/explore/telescopes/ska-low">SKA-low</a>.
    </p><p>
        My intention is to stay within the academic and teaching space as a career. For quite a while I have wanted to be a professor and researcher, teaching the next generation and contributing to our collective knowledge of the cosmos and physics itself.
    </p><p>
        I have a bachelor's degree in science with first class honours from the Australian National University in Canberra - of which I graduated in December 2024. During my degree, I majored in Astronomy and minored in Computer Science. My honours thesis there was focused on the magnetic draping effect applied to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-velocity_cloud">High Velocity Clouds (HVCs)</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warm-hot_intergalactic_medium">Circumgalactic Medium (CGM)</a> - working with <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2730-957X">Prof. Naomi McClure-Griffiths</a> and <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6243-7879">Dr. Craig Anderson</a> at the Mt. Stromlo Observatory. I primarily relied on data from the <a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/about/facilities-collections/atnf/askap-radio-telescope">Australian Square Kilometre Array</a> (ASKAP)'s <a href="https://possum-survey.org">Polarisation Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism</a> (POSSUM).
    </p><p>
        I also worked for a semester with <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4283-5159">Dr. Brad Tucker</a> and <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1731-0497">Prof. Christopher Lidman</a> on the <a href="https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/debass/">Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky Survey (DEBASS)</a>. This survey sought to follow up on low redshift type Ia supernovae - following up on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Energy_Survey">Dark Energy Survey (DES)</a> made prior to 2021.

        There were many more interesting courses and learning experiences across my degree. In Physics, I learnt both General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory, and in Astronomy, I have also learnt Magnetohydrodynamics and other phenomena like Cosmic Rays. This contributes to a very wide portfolio of knowledge in the realm of Physics and Astronomy - and it has been extremely useful in my career.
    </p><p>
        Next to Astrophysics, Computer Science is my next favourite subject - which I have always had a soft spot for. My favorite parts of CS are mainly theoretical components. Logic, programming paradigms, and automata - I spend some of my spare time coming up with new programming language concepts and learning new computer languages. However I can always appreciate good software design - and have a keen eye for such things. In 2022 I took a course on “Computer Organisation and Program Execution” - all about how a computer works on the nitty gritty levels including teaching assembly itself.
    </p><p>
        I've had a small career as a software developer. I learnt most of my skills in HSC Software Design and Development, and put those skills to the test at both <a href="https://nextgen.group">Nextgen Distribution</a> in Sydney and <a href="https://agiledigital.com.au">Agile Digital Engineering</a> in Canberra.
    </p><p>
        Speaking of High School, I attended <a href="https://scots.college">The Scots College</a> in Sydney - graduating from there in October 2020. While it was a private school I honestly think that any public school is capable of giving students a great education. I don't feel the need to discuss my accolades back then - it should be clear that I was a good student. However just for the sake of it my <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/study/applying/how-to-apply/undergraduate/atar-explained.html">ATAR</a> was 98.35 - reminder that I spent my Year 12 in the middle of the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns.
    </p><p>
        I also did some fun and interesting things during my time in High School, including being the Captain of the Audio Visual department, learning the trumpet and the drums. I also did the <a href="https://dukeofed.com.au">Duke of Edinburgh</a> - Bronze, Silver, and Gold - which is how I came to love hiking. In 2017 I went to <a href="https://scots.college/visit-scots/campuses/glengarry/">Glengarry</a>, which was an outdoor education facility in Kangaroo Valley run by my high school. There I learned a lot of life and survival skills (and also got extremely fit).
